    "Improved technical decision extraction with better keyword matching Technical decisions now properly extracted and displayed in /start output",
    "Completed rolling cumulative recap system for AI memory persistence OpenCode automatically stores all sessions via /session API. Our system adds intelligent condensation on top for optimal AI memory injection without prompt bloat.",
    "Tested session persistence system by restoring previous context and verifying session manager functionality Using quick-finish command to avoid interactive input during testing",
    "Completed Phase 3: Core AI Architecture - Designed and implemented main AI assistant script with session persistence, OpenCode consultation, and script orchestration capabilities. Updated AGENTS.md with complete project knowledge base. Phase 3 complete - AI assistant architecture implemented successfully with all major components working"

  "architecture_changes": [
    "Redesigned session persistence system with rolling cumulative recap Session manager now creates intelligent condensed recaps optimized for AI memory injection",
    "Fixed extraction logic in session manager to handle plain text inputs Session manager now properly extracts next steps, technical decisions, and architecture changes from unstructured text",
    "Improved technical decision extraction with better keyword matching Session manager now captures technical decisions from unstructured text using enhanced pattern recognition",
    "Completed rolling cumulative recap system for AI memory persistence Session manager now perfectly extracts and condenses session context into optimized AI memory format. /finish and /start commands work flawlessly with intelligent extraction of next steps, technical decisions, and architecture changes. System prevents bloat while preserving all critical information.",
    "Tested session persistence system by restoring previous context and verifying session manager functionality Session persistence system is working correctly - able to restore previous session context from JSON and markdown files. Session manager has quick-finish capability for non-interactive testing.",
    "Completed Phase 3: Core AI Architecture - Designed and implemented main AI assistant script with session persistence, OpenCode consultation, and script orchestration capabilities. Updated AGENTS.md with complete project knowledge base. AI Assistant is now fully functional with async architecture, session management, OpenCode integration, and child script orchestration. All core components tested and working. Project ready for production use."
