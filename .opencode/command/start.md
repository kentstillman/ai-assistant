---description: Restore session context and continue work---
Load the most recent session context to understand where we left off.

Read the latest session file from /Assistant/sessions/ and restore:
- Previous accomplishments
- Current project state  
- Immediate next steps
- Technical context (git status, service status)

Based on the restored context, continue with the planned work focusing on:
1. GitHub authentication (code: 334B-DFA8)
2. Repository creation and push
3. Phase 3: Core AI Architecture design

Ask me what I should help you with first based on the restored context.
