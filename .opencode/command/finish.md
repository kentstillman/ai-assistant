---description: Save session and clear memory---
Save the current session context including:
- Accomplishments during this session
- Current project state
- Next steps for future work
- Important notes and insights

After saving, restart the opencode.service to clear memory
and provide clear signal that it's safe to close the CLI window.

Session files are saved to /home/kent/Assistant/sessions/ with both
JSON and markdown formats for easy reference.
